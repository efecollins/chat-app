## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

I learnt a lot of things while building this or making this project. When doing responsiveness, write your code from desktop to mobile or mobile to desktop(not my thing).

Use your ::after or ::before pseudo-elemnts when you get to where it is of neccessity because at the latter there might be diffulculties.


### Continued development

In future projects, I will like to do more JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [CodeSTACKr](https://www.codestackr.com) - This helped me for Flexbox and Sass.
